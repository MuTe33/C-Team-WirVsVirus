# WirVsVirus - Hackathon

## Inspiration

News about the corona virus is complex, dynamic and varies from state to state. There are also rumours and conspiracy theories. People need a simple solution to get official and relevant information.

## What it does

The app bundles official information, guidelines and regulations. Users can call up relevant information for their district and personal situation (e.g. risk group, neighbourhood help, etc.) at a glance - just like a weather app. The official news feed of the Federal Government, a daily podcast and an FAQ are also integrated. The information is designed in such a way that it can be shared quickly and easily. In this way, we give people additional help to keep the infection curve flat.
